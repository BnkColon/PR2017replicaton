## Replicability of large Pharmacological Studies

Hopefully you have had the chance to explore the features of the CCLE and GDSC drug response datasets. If not, it might be a good idea to check out the vignette on 'Exploratory analysis of pharmacogenomic data' to get a feel for what types of variables the datasets contain, and learn about the difference between the raw dataset, which contains the cell line viability at each drug concentration, and the summarized dataset, which contains numerical summaries of the cell lines response to a drug over all concentrations. We'll briefly explore what this means in the next section.

## Summary measurements of drug response

Recall that in the summarized dataset, for each cell line and drug combination, the cell line viability over all drug concentrations has been summarized into a single number, which represents the *overall effect of the drug on the cell line*. Essentially, There are many different ways this could be done, and our data provides two possible measures: 

1. IC50: the estimated concentration of the drug that will result in half (50%) of the cells surviving. 

![](Figures/IC50.jpg)

Are cell lines with higher IC50 values more or less susceptible? What about drugs with higher IC50 values - are they more or less toxic?

2. AUC (Area Under the Curve): the area under the curve estimated by the drug concentration and viability data. Note that the estimation of this curve is not a simple task in itself - check out the vignette on summarizing the relationship between two variables to learn more. 

![](Figures/AUC.jpg)

Are cell lines with higher values of AUC more or less resistant? Are drugs with higher AUC more or less toxic?

## Load the summarized pharmacological dataset into the session
First, we'll read in the .csv file that contains the summarized pharmacological data (including the IC50 and AUC values for each drug and cell line combination, as described above). 

```{r read csv}
cellLinesSummary <- read.csv("summarizedPharmacoData.csv", header=TRUE)
str(cellLinesSummary)

length(unique(cellLinesSummary$cellLine))
length(unique(cellLinesSummary$drug))
```

Notice that there are 2,257 rows - each row here corresponds to a cell line-drug combination. 
Making up these combinations are 288 unique cell lines, and 15 drugs. 

Was every cell line in the dataset tested with every drug?

## Comparing response of drug AZD0530 in the two studies

So we now have summary measures (IC50 and AUC) that indicate the response of each cell line to each drug (though not all combinations were included). However, each study measured these values independently. The goal of this analysis is to **investigate how well these two studies agree with each other**. In other words, do the drug response results in one study **replicate** in the other study? 

First, we'll examine this question for one of the drugs in particular: AZD0530. We'll start out by visually exploring how the AUC values for AZD0530 compare in the two datasets using a scatterplot.

```{r AUC 1 drug}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(x=auc_GDSC, y=auc_CCLE), data=subset(cellLinesSummary, drug=="AZD0530")) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("GDSC AUC") +
    ylab("CCLE AUC") 
```

How would you describe the level of agreement between the AUC values of drug AZD0530 in the CCLE and GDSC studies? Does it seem like higher values of AUC in the GDSC correspond to higher values in the CCLE?

> Place your answer here

Next, let's look at the same type of scatterplot for the IC50 values. 

```{r ic50 1 drug}
ggplot(aes(x=ic50_GDSC, y=ic50_CCLE), data=subset(cellLinesSummary, drug=="AZD0530")) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("GDSC IC50") +
    ylab("CCLE IC50") 
```

What is different about this plot compared to the AUC plot for this drug above? 

First, notice that there are many points with the highest value of IC50 for CCLE. Recall that this study measured a fixed set of doses, regardless of how the cells responded, whereas in the GDSC drug concentrations were increased until half of the cells were killed. What does this mean for the IC50 values in the CCLE? Are they more likely to be too high or too low? Why?

> Place your answer here

Another thing to notice is that there is a very large range of IC50 values in the GDSC, but most values are small. This indicates a *skewed* distribution that may benefit from a log-transformation. Next, we'll plot log10-transformed values of IC50. We'll also plot *negative* values, so that increasing values of IC50 represent increasing drug toxicity (to make the plot more comparable to the AUC plot above).

```{r ic50 1 drug log}
ggplot(aes(x=-log10(ic50_GDSC), y=-log(ic50_CCLE)), data=subset(cellLinesSummary, drug=="AZD0530")) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50)") 
```


How would you describe the level of agreement between the IC50 values of drug AZD0530 in the CCLE and GDSC studies? Does it seem like higher values of AUC in the GDSC correspond to higher values in the CCLE?

## Comparing summary measures of drug response across all drugs

So far, we have only looked at how well the two studies agree for the response measurements of a single drug. However, we need to look at the rest of the drugs to fully assess the level of replication. First, we set out to reproduce Figure 2 in the Haibe-Kains paper, which displays 
scatter plots of IC50 values for the 15 drugs that were probed in both the CCLE and GDSC. Essentially, we are going to make the plots from the previous section for all 15 drugs at once and compare them side-by-side.

```{r Fig2 raw}
ggplot(aes(x=-log10(ic50_GDSC), y=-log10(ic50_CCLE)), data=cellLinesSummary) +
    geom_point() + 
    facet_wrap(facets=~drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50)") 
```

Why do the ranges of the axes not exactly match the axes in Figure 2 of the published paper? Note that the concentrations reported in the `cellLinesSummary` dataset are given in units of mili-molar, however the plots contain values calculated on the nano-molar
scale (1 million times smaller). Thus, we can reproduce the original plot's scale by scaling the concentration values by 10^6.

```{r Fig2 nano}
ggplot(aes(x=-log10(ic50_GDSC/10^6), y=-log10(ic50_CCLE/10^6)), data=cellLinesSummary) +
    geom_point() + 
    facet_wrap(facets=~drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50/10^6)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50/10^6)") 
```

Looking at the IC50 values for both studies across all 15 drugs, would you say that they tend to agree? Why or why not?

Next, we'll create a similar figure as above, but for the other summary measure (AUC). This is shown in the Extended Data Figure 5 in Haibe-Kains et al. paper.

```{r ED Fig5 raw}
ggplot(aes(x=auc_GDSC, y=auc_CCLE), data=cellLinesSummary) +
    geom_point() + 
    facet_wrap(facets=~drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC AUC)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE AUC)") 
```

Looking at the AUC values for both studies across all 15 drugs, would you say that they tend to agree? Why or why not?

We have visually inspected the agreement of the drug response data between the two studies. Now, we'd like to go a step further and quantify the agreement with statistics. We'll start by exploring measures of correlation.

## Compare correlations of the drug sensitivity measures

One way to quantify the degree of agreement of two variables is to calculate the *correlation*. Correlation is a statistic between -1 and 1 that measures the degree of association between two variables. In this case our two variables are the drug response in CCLE and the drug response for GDSC. The higher the correlation value, the more the two variables agree with one other. If two variables are exactly the same, then the correlation is equal to 1. If two variables are unrelated, then the correlation value will be close to zero. What would a negative correlation mean?

Note that there are several different types of correlations. For example, we might say that two variables are in agreement if they fall along a straight line when plotted against eachother. Or, we might say they two are in agreement if an increase in one tends to be associated with an increase in the other (but not necessarily along a straight line). We'll start by examining two different types:

1. **Pearson's** correlation coefficient: measures the degree of *linear* association 

2. **Spearman's** correlation coefficient: measures the agreement of the *rankings* of the values of one variable compared to the other.

Here we'll summarize different measures of correlation of the IC50 values and the AUC values to assess the level of 
replication between these two experiments. First, we'll compute the two different measures for correlating 
continous variables mentioned above (Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients).

```{r ic50 correlation}
library(dplyr)

drugCorrs <- cellLinesSummary %>% 
    group_by(drug) %>% summarise(Pearson_ic50=cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC/10^6),-log10(ic50_CCLE/10^6), method="pearson"),
                                 Spearman_ic50=cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC/10^6),-log10(ic50_CCLE/10^6), method="spearman"),
                                 Pearson_auc=cor(auc_GDSC,auc_CCLE, method="pearson"),
                                 Spearman_auc=cor(auc_GDSC,auc_CCLE, method="spearman"))

drugCorrs
```

Next, we'll visualize these correlations, first for the IC50 measurements, in a grouped bar plot.

```{r barplot correlations ic50}
library(reshape2)
drugCorrs <- melt(drugCorrs)
colnames(drugCorrs) <- c("Drug", "Measure", "Correlation")

drugCorrs_IC50 <- drugCorrs[grep("ic50", drugCorrs$Measure),]
ggplot(data=drugCorrs_IC50, aes(x=Drug, y=Correlation, fill=Measure, group=Measure)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge(), colour="black") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_grey()
```

Next, we'll make the same plot for the AUC correlations.

```{r barplot correlations auc}
drugCorrs_AUC <- drugCorrs[grep("auc", drugCorrs$Measure),]
ggplot(data=drugCorrs_AUC, aes(x=Drug, y=Correlation, fill=Measure, group=Measure)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge(), colour="black") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_grey()
```

Which measure (AUC or IC50) suggests more agreement between the studies? Does this agree to your answer to this same question in the previous section using visual inspection?

Examining these correlation values, which drug do you think shows the most consistency between the studies? How about the least? Does this agree with your visual assessment and answers to these same questions in the previous section?

Examine the results for the drug Nilotinib. Why does this drug seem to have a high Pearson correlation, but a low Spearman correlation?

## Further exploration

Here are some suggestions and questions for you to explore with your team:

1. We have explored Pearson's and Spearman correlation, but what about other correlation measures? For example, you could try out distance correlation, which is sensitive to nonlinear relationships. You can find this measure in the `energy' R package, which you'll need to install and load with the following commands:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("energy")
load(energy)
```

    Then, you can compute distance correlation with the `dcor()` function. How does this correlation measure compare to Pearson's and Spearman's? Do your conclusions about the agreement between the two studies change at all using this measure?

2. In the analyses thus far, we have treated all cell lines and drugs equally. However, we know that some cell lines may be more sensitive to drug treatment. We also know that some drugs may be more toxic than others. Consider, for example, a drug that is not very effective (low toxicity) on any cell line. Would you expect that drug to show high correlation of AUC and IC50 between the two studies? What about a drug that is extremely toxic to some of the cell lines? 

    The drug Crizotinib is known to be toxic only to a small subset of cell lines. Are the results of the two studies consistent with this?

    The drug Sorafenib is not very toxic to any of the cell lines in the study. Should we conclude that the studies were not in agreement if the correlations for this drug were low?
